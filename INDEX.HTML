    <p>Switzerland originates from the Old Swiss Confederacy established in the Late Middle Ages, following a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy; the Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the country's founding document. Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Switzerland has maintained a policy of armed neutrality since the 16th century and has not fought an international war since 1815. It joined the United Nations only in 2002 but pursues an active foreign policy that includes frequent involvement in peace building.</p>

    <p>One of the most popular destinations in the Swiss Alps is the Matterhorn, one of the tallest peaks in Europe. It’s a breathtaking sight, especially when the sun is shining and the sky is clear. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can hike up to the top and enjoy a panoramic view of the surrounding landscape.

        Another must-see destination in the Swiss Alps is the Grindelwald, a charming village surrounded by stunning mountains and glaciers. Grindelwald is famous for its ski resort, but it’s also a popular spot for summer activities, such as hiking, mountain biking, and paragliding.
        
        And let’s not forget about the lakes. Switzerland is home to some of the most beautiful and serene lakes in the world. Lake Geneva is one of the largest and most famous lakes in Switzerland, known for its stunning views and picturesque towns. It’s also a popular destination for water sports, such as sailing, windsurfing, and kayaking.</p>

            Climate In Switzerland
        </span>

<section class=" section section-1">
    <p>The Swiss climate is generally temperate, but can vary greatly across localities,[69] from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the near-Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. Some valley areas in the southern part of Switzerland offer cold-hardy palm trees. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall, ideal for pastures/grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see weeks-long intervals of stable conditions. At the same time, the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion during such periods, hiding the sun.[citation needed]
        A weather phenomenon known as the föhn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur any time and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing low relative humidity air to the north of the Alps during rainfall periods on the south-facing slopes. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect. The driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their moisture content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas. Large alpine areas such as Graubünden remain drier than pre-alpine areas, and as in the main valley of the Valais, wine grapes are grown there.</p>
